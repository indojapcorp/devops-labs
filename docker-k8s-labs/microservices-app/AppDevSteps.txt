That sounds like an exciting project! Developing a CRUD web app using microservices is a great way to learn about modern application architecture. I will walk you through the steps to achieve this, broken down into several key parts:

1. **Set up the Project Structure:**
   We will be creating multiple services in the app. Each microservice will be responsible for a specific task, like handling different aspects of the CRUD operations.

   Let's assume you are building a simple app that manages **users**.

2. **Create Services:**
   - **User Service**: Handles CRUD operations related to users (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - **Database Service**: The MongoDB service that will store user data.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

### 1. **Set up Node.js Project with Express:**

We'll start with a simple CRUD application with Node.js and Express.

#### Project Structure:
```plaintext
microservices-app/
  ├── user-service/
  ├── database-service/
  ├── docker-compose.yml
  └── Kubernetes/
```

### 2. **Creating the User Service:**

**Navigate to `user-service/` folder and initialize it with Node.js**:
```bash
mkdir user-service
cd user-service
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose
```

**Create a simple `server.js` for User Service:**

```javascript
// user-service/server.js
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

// Initialize express
const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// MongoDB connection
mongoose.connect('mongodb://database-service:27017/users', {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
}).then(() => console.log("Connected to MongoDB"))
  .catch((err) => console.error("Error connecting to MongoDB:", err));

// Create a user schema
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    email: String,
});

// Create a User model
const User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

// CRUD Routes

// Create User
app.post('/users', async (req, res) => {
    const user = new User(req.body);
    try {
        await user.save();
        res.status(201).send(user);
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(400).send(err);
    }
});

// Read Users
app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const users = await User.find();
        res.status(200).send(users);
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(400).send(err);
    }
});

// Update User
app.put('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const user = await User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, { new: true });
        res.status(200).send(user);
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(400).send(err);
    }
});

// Delete User
app.delete('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        await User.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id);
        res.status(200).send({ message: "User deleted" });
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(400).send(err);
    }
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("User service is running on port 3000");
});
```

### 3. **Creating the MongoDB Service:**

We will run MongoDB as a separate service within the Kubernetes cluster, but we will configure it via `docker-compose.yml` in case you're testing locally before deploying.

**No need for code in this service** since MongoDB is just a containerized database service.

### 4. **Create Dockerfiles for Each Service:**

#### User Service Dockerfile (`user-service/Dockerfile`):

```Dockerfile
# Use Node.js base image
FROM node:16

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose port and run the app
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

#### MongoDB Dockerfile (`database-service/Dockerfile`):

```Dockerfile
# Use official MongoDB image
FROM mongo:latest

# Expose MongoDB port
EXPOSE 27017
```

### 5. **Create `docker-compose.yml`:**

You can use Docker Compose for local development before moving to Kubernetes.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  user-service:
    build:
      context: ./user-service
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - MONGO_URL=mongodb://database-service:27017/users
    depends_on:
      - database-service

  database-service:
    build:
      context: ./database-service
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
```

### 6. **Run the Docker Containers Locally**:
To test everything together with Docker Compose, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start both the `user-service` and `database-service`.

### 7. **Set Up Kubernetes Deployment:**

Now, let's create Kubernetes manifests for deploying these services.

#### `user-service-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: user-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: user-service
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: user-service
          image: user-service:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
          env:
            - name: MONGO_URL
              value: "mongodb://database-service:27017/users"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: user-service
  ports:
    - port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
```

#### `database-service-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: database-service
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: database-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: database-service
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: database-service
          image: mongo:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 27017
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: database-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: database-service
  ports:
    - port: 27017
      targetPort: 27017
```

### 8. **Deploy to Kubernetes:**

You can now apply these Kubernetes manifests to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f Kubernetes/database-service-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f Kubernetes/user-service-deployment.yaml
```

### 9. **Testing the Microservices:**

Once everything is deployed on Kubernetes, you can test the services by using the `kubectl port-forward` command to expose the services locally:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/user-service 3000:3000
kubectl port-forward svc/database-service 27017:27017
```

Now, you can make HTTP requests to `http://localhost:3000/users` to interact with your API.

---

### Final Thoughts:

- This setup uses Docker to containerize each service and Kubernetes to manage the deployments and orchestration.
- You can also scale these services up and down using Kubernetes and manage them with more advanced concepts like namespaces, ingress, or persistent storage (for MongoDB).
- For production environments, consider adding configurations for logging, monitoring, and security (such as JWT authentication).

---------------
Great! Using lightweight images for your services is a smart decision, especially when you're aiming for a fast, resource-efficient setup. For your M1 MacBook Air, I understand the importance of using efficient images and leveraging k3s with Multipass. Here’s how you can achieve this.

### 1. **Smallest Possible Images for Node and MongoDB**

To minimize the size of your images, we’ll use **alpine**-based images. Alpine is a minimal Docker image that can significantly reduce the size of your containers.

#### **Node Service:**
The official Node.js image based on Alpine Linux is very lightweight. You can use it as your base image for the Node.js service.

**Dockerfile for Node.js Service (`user-service/Dockerfile`):**

```Dockerfile
# Use Node.js Alpine image (lightweight)
FROM node:16-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app will run on
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

By using the `node:16-alpine` image, the final image size will be much smaller than using a full-fledged `node:16` image.

#### **MongoDB Service:**

The official MongoDB image is quite large because it includes all the necessary dependencies for a full database environment. For production use, **Alpine** has an official MongoDB image as well, which is much smaller.

**Dockerfile for MongoDB Service (`database-service/Dockerfile`):**

```Dockerfile
# Use the official MongoDB Alpine image (small)
FROM mongo:6.0-alpine

# Expose MongoDB port
EXPOSE 27017
```

This will provide a MongoDB image based on Alpine, making it much smaller than the standard MongoDB image.

### 2. **Using k3s with Multipass for Kubernetes on M1 MacBook**

#### **Prerequisites:**
- **Multipass**: A tool to launch and manage Ubuntu VMs locally.
- **k3s**: A lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for edge computing and IoT devices, ideal for local clusters.
  
Multipass and k3s are perfect for your MacBook Air M1 since they provide a lightweight and efficient Kubernetes setup.

##### **Step-by-Step Setup for k3s with Multipass:**

1. **Install Multipass on macOS:**
   Install Multipass using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install --cask multipass
   ```

2. **Launch a Multipass VM for k3s:**
   On your Mac M1, create an Ubuntu VM using Multipass. This VM will run your k3s cluster.

   ```bash
   multipass launch --name k3s-vm --mem 2G --disk 10G --cpus 2
   ```

   This will launch a VM with 2GB of memory, 10GB of disk space, and 2 CPUs. You can adjust these resources based on your system's capabilities.

3. **Access the VM:**
   Once the VM is up and running, connect to it using:

   ```bash
   multipass shell k3s-vm
   ```

4. **Install k3s on the VM:**
   Now that you're inside the VM, you can install k3s by running the following script:

   ```bash
   curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
   ```

5. **Verify k3s Installation:**
   Once installed, you can verify that k3s is running:

   ```bash
   sudo k3s kubectl get nodes
   ```

6. **Set up kubectl on your macOS:**
   After installing k3s on the VM, you’ll need to configure your MacBook Air to interact with the k3s cluster.

   First, copy the kubeconfig file from the VM:

   ```bash
   multipass exec k3s-vm -- sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml > ~/.kube/config
   ```

   Now set the environment variable for `kubectl` to use the `k3s` cluster:

   ```bash
   export KUBEVIRT_URL=$(multipass info k3s-vm | grep IPv4 | awk '{print $2}')
   ```

7. **Enable Port Forwarding on Kubernetes Cluster:**
   When running your services on Kubernetes, you'll likely want to forward certain ports locally (e.g., `3000` for your Node.js app).

   Use `kubectl port-forward` for this:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/user-service 3000:3000
   ```

   This will forward port `3000` from your `user-service` to your local machine, allowing you to access the service at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. **Kubernetes Configurations**

Now that you have a lightweight environment for k3s, let's revisit the Kubernetes deployment configuration.

You already have the deployment YAML files for both services (`user-service` and `database-service`). You'll just need to build and push your images to a container registry, or build them locally and deploy them to the k3s cluster.

#### **Build Docker Images Locally:**

Run these commands to build your Docker images for both services:

For the **user service**:
```bash
docker build -t user-service:latest ./user-service
```

For the **database service**:
```bash
docker build -t database-service:latest ./database-service
```

#### **Push the Images to a Container Registry (Optional):**

If you prefer, you can push your images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Packages, etc.) to easily pull them in Kubernetes. For example, for Docker Hub:

```bash
docker tag user-service:latest your-dockerhub-username/user-service:latest
docker push your-dockerhub-username/user-service:latest

docker tag database-service:latest your-dockerhub-username/database-service:latest
docker push your-dockerhub-username/database-service:latest
```

Make sure to update the Kubernetes manifests to reflect the correct image URLs if you're pushing to a registry.

#### **Deploy to Kubernetes (k3s):**

Finally, deploy your services to the k3s cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f Kubernetes/database-service-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f Kubernetes/user-service-deployment.yaml
```

You can use `kubectl get pods` to verify that the services are running, and `kubectl port-forward` to access them locally.

---

### Recap:

1. **Node and MongoDB**: We're using `node:16-alpine` and `mongo:6.0-alpine` for smaller Docker images.
2. **k3s with Multipass**: This setup will use k3s (lightweight Kubernetes) running on a Multipass Ubuntu VM.
3. **Docker Images**: We build Docker images locally or push them to a container registry for use in the Kubernetes cluster.
4. **Kubernetes Deployment**: We deploy the services using Kubernetes manifests.

With these steps, you will have a lightweight and efficient Kubernetes setup running microservices with k3s on your M1 MacBook Air.
