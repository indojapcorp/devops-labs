to expose LocalStack (or any service running on your laptop) to the internet, there are a few good options. Here are some free alternatives to ngrok:

1. Localtunnel
Localtunnel is a simple and free tool that can expose your local server to the internet.

How to use Localtunnel:

Install Localtunnel globally:

bash
Copy
npm install -g localtunnel
Expose your LocalStack service (running on port 4566) to the internet:

bash
Copy
lt --port 4566
Localtunnel will provide a URL, like https://randomsubdomain.localtunnel.me, which you can use in your GitHub Actions workflow to point to your LocalStack instance.
